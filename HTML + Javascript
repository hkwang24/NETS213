        <p id="s1"> You come back home after a long day of work, throwing your keys down on the nearest flat surface. After changing out of your work clothes and getting a bite of food to eat, you go to the computer to check your email. The light in the office room is already on -- unusual, but you assure yourself that you probably forgot to turn it off on your way out that morning. As you are booting the computer up, you notice a strange DVD sitting on top of the monitor.</p>

You loose your footing and  trip a couple of times, once on the gnarled roots of a gigantic blue and purple tree, and another time on something that shifted and squeaked, and then ran from under your foot. You didn't know what it was, but you saw grass ruffling, moving, and swirling, as the critter -- or whatever it was -- bounced and scampered off into the darkened forest, piquing your curiosity.\n\nThere is still something odd.

The letter is written in binary code, ones and zeroes, and there is blood on the letter as well. The first DVD appearing to not have worked, you remove it and place in the other disc. This one starts up right away and it is your girlfriend in a dark room, gagged and in a familiar place -- you can not quite discern where, though. Blue lights flash in a pulsating rhythm right before a man in a mask appears, glitching like a VHS tape. He starts to talk, and that's when your heart drops -- this is real, although how and why are anyone's guess. You don't understand what is going on, but you try to keep your cool as you process the situation. You really hope that this doesn't=have anything to do with the three bodies you and your girlfriend hid under the floorboards at that party two weekends ago.
